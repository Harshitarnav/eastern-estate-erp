## 🔧 Additional Pages Needed (Quick to Build)

To have a complete system, you'll need these pages. I can continue building them, or you can test the dashboard first:

### Priority 1: Core Pages
1. **Tasks Page** - `/sales/tasks/page.tsx`
   - List all tasks
   - Filter by status
   - Mark complete
   - Create new task

2. **Follow-ups Page** - `/sales/followups/page.tsx`
   - List all follow-ups by lead
   - Create new follow-up
   - View history

3. **Target Tracker** - `/sales/targets/page.tsx`
   - View current target
   - Set self-target
   - Track progress

### Priority 2: Forms
4. **New Task Form** - `/sales/tasks/new/page.tsx`
5. **New Follow-up Form** - `/sales/followups/new/page.tsx`
6. **Enhanced Lead Form** - Update existing lead forms with new CRM fields

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Test the dashboard first!**

The dashboard is the heart of the system. It shows:
- All your metrics
- Performance tracking
- Upcoming tasks
- Recent activities

Once you see it working and like the design, I can quickly build the remaining pages following the same pattern.

**Command to test**:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend (already running)
cd backend
npm run start:dev

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Browser: http://localhost:3000/sales
```

---

**Want me to**:
1. ✅ Keep building remaining pages? (Say "continue")
2. ✅ Wait for you to test dashboard? (Say "let me test first")
3. ✅ Build a specific page next? (Say which one)

Let me know! 🚀
