# Quick Start Guide - Event-Driven Booking System

## ðŸš€ Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Run Database Migration (2 minutes)

```bash
# Connect to your PostgreSQL database
psql -U eastern_estate -d eastern_estate_erp

# Inside psql, run:
\i /path/to/eastern-estate-erp/database-migration-booking-system.sql

# You should see:
# NOTICE: SUCCESS: payment_schedules table created
# NOTICE: SUCCESS: bookings.payment_plan column added
# NOTICE: SUCCESS: customers.last_booking_date column added
```

### Step 2: Configure Email (1 minute)

**Option A: Using Gmail (Recommended for Testing)**

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Create a new app password
3. Add to `backend/.env`:

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
EMAIL_FROM=Eastern Estate <noreply@easternestates.com>
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@easternestates.com
```

**Option B: Test Without Real Emails**

Use Mailtrap (free): https://mailtrap.io

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
EMAIL_PORT=2525
EMAIL_USER=your-mailtrap-user
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-mailtrap-password
EMAIL_FROM=Eastern Estate <noreply@easternestates.com>
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@easternestates.com
```

```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Emails not received

**Check 1:** Backend logs
```bash
cd backend
tail -f logs/application.log | grep -i email
```

**Check 2:** Email configuration
```bash
# Verify .env has correct settings
cat backend/.env | grep EMAIL
```

**Check 3:** SMTP credentials
- Gmail: Verify App Password (not regular password)
- Check 2FA is enabled
- Try sending test email manually

### Issue: Flat shows as AVAILABLE after booking

**Check:** Transaction completion
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE booking_number = 'your-number';
SELECT status FROM flats WHERE id = 'your-flat-id';
```

If booking exists but flat is AVAILABLE, check backend logs for transaction errors.

### Issue: Payment schedule not created

**Check:** Schedule records
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment_schedules WHERE booking_id = 'your-booking-id';
```

If count is 0, check backend logs:
```bash
grep "Payment schedule generated" backend/logs/application.log
```

## ðŸ“Š View Payment Schedules

### In Database:
```sql
SELECT 
    ps.schedule_number,
    ps.installment_number || ' of ' || ps.total_installments AS installment,
    ps.due_date,
    ps.amount,
    ps.description,
    ps.status
FROM payment_schedules ps
WHERE ps.booking_id = 'your-booking-id'
ORDER BY ps.installment_number;
```
