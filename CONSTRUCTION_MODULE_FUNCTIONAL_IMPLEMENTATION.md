## ‚úÖ ERRORS FIXED

### 1. TypeORM Entity/Schema Mismatch
**Problem:** The ConstructionProject entity didn't match the database schema
- Entity had `siteEngineerId` but database had `project_manager_id`
- Entity referenced non-existent `tower` relation
- Entity had columns that didn't exist in database

**Solution:**
- Updated `construction-project.entity.ts` to match database schema exactly
- Changed `siteEngineer` ‚Üí `projectManager` 
- Added proper relations for `tower`, `flat`
- Removed non-existent columns (projectCode, projectPhase, contractorName, etc.)
- Fixed service queries to use correct relations: `['property', 'tower', 'flat', 'projectManager']`

### 2. Service Query Issues
**Problem:** Service was querying for relations and columns that don't exist
**Solution:**
- Removed `isActive` filter (column doesn't exist in database)
- Fixed all find queries to use existing relations only
- Updated `remove()` method to actually delete records

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

The construction module now has a **solid, functional foundation** with:

All buttons, forms, and interfaces for **project management are operational**. Additional modules (materials, vendors, POs, progress logs) have the UI structure in place and need backend integration and form completion to be fully functional.

The system is ready for user testing and iterative enhancement based on field feedback.
