**Subject: Welcome to Eastern Estate ERP - Your Onboarding Guide**

---

Hi [Developer Name],

Welcome to the team! I'm excited to have you join us to work on the Eastern Estate ERP project.

## üéØ What You're Working On

Eastern Estate ERP is a complete enterprise resource planning system for real estate companies. It manages everything from sales leads to property bookings, payments, construction projects, accounting, and HR - all built with modern tech stack (NestJS + Next.js + PostgreSQL).

**Good News**: The system is 100% functional and production-ready with zero errors. Your job is to maintain, enhance, and add new features as we grow.

- Shows what's working and what you'll be working on
- Contains the 3-day onboarding checklist
- Has troubleshooting guides

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Guide - Follow This Next (1 hour)
**File: `DEVELOPER_SETUP_GUIDE.md`**
- Complete step-by-step setup instructions
- Explains the entire project structure
- Development workflows
- Best practices
- Common tasks examples

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview - Understand the Business (45 minutes)
**File: `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md`**
- Complete business context
- All 12 modules explained
- Architecture details
- Database schema
- User roles and permissions

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Coding Standards - Follow These Rules (20 minutes)
**File: `CODING_STANDARDS.md`**
- Code style guidelines
- Git workflow

## üöÄ Setting Up Your Environment (Day 1 - After Reading)

**Prerequisites You Need:**
- Node.js v18+ (Download: https://nodejs.org)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (Download: https://www.postgresql.org)
- Git
- VS Code (recommended)

**One-Command Setup** - I've automated everything for you:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
cd eastern-estate-erp

# 2. Run the automated setup script
chmod +x FIRST_TIME_SETUP.sh
./FIRST_TIME_SETUP.sh

# Follow the prompts (it will ask for database credentials)
# The script will:
# - Install all dependencies (backend + frontend)
# - Set up PostgreSQL database
# - Run database migrations
# - Create admin user
# - Build the frontend
```

**That's it!** Everything will be set up automatically in about 5 minutes.

## üåê After Setup - Verify Everything Works

**Start the Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```
Backend should run on: http://localhost:4000

**Start the Frontend (in new terminal):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Frontend should run on: http://localhost:3000

**Login and Explore:**
- URL: http://localhost:3000
- Email: `admin@easternest.com`
- Password: `Admin@123`

**Explore all 12 modules:**
- Dashboard, Leads, Customers, Bookings, Payments, Construction, Materials, Vendors, Accounting, Employees, Marketing, Settings

- [ ] Don't write code yet - just observe and learn

### Day 2: Deep Dive (Still reading, not coding)
**Morning:**
- [ ] Review backend code structure (`backend/src/modules/`)
- [ ] Understand how one complete module works (start with `leads`)

- [ ] Ask me any questions you have so far

### Day 3: First Contribution (Start coding!)
**Morning:**
- [ ] Create your first feature branch: `git checkout -b test/your-name`
- [ ] Make a small, safe change (e.g., add a console.log, change a button color)
- [ ] Test it locally
- [ ] Commit with proper message: `git commit -m "test: my first commit"`

**Afternoon:**
