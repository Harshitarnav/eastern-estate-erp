## How to Access

### 1. Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/login
```

### 2. Login with:
```

Password: Password@123
```

### 3. Navigate to Sales Dashboard:
```

### 4. Test other pages:
- **Leads**: `http://localhost:3000/leads`
- **Customers**: `http://localhost:3000/customers`
- **Bookings**: `http://localhost:3000/bookings`

## If Pages Are Empty

This is normal! The dashboard will be empty if:
- No sales targets created for your user
- No leads assigned to you
- No tasks or follow-ups

To add data:
1. Go to Leads page and click "Add Lead"
2. Go to Employees page and add sales targets
3. Create tasks and follow-ups

## Troubleshooting

### If Sales Dashboard is still blank:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for any red errors
3. Check if you're logged in (look for `accessToken` in localStorage)
4. Try refreshing the page

### If you see "Unauthorized" errors:
1. Log out and log back in
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health`

### If pages show 404:
1. Make sure frontend is running on port 3000
2. Check frontend logs: `tail -f frontend/frontend.log`
3. Restart frontend if needed

## What to Report

If you still see errors, please share:
1. **Browser console errors** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. **Which page** you're trying to access
3. **What you see** on the page (screenshot helps)
4. **Backend logs**: Check `backend/server.log`

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test Sales Dashboard - Should show metrics and widgets
2. ‚úÖ Test Leads page - Should show lead list or empty state
3. ‚úÖ Test Customers page - Should show customer list or empty state
4. ‚úÖ Test Bookings page - Should show bookings list or empty state
