# Sales Dashboard Error Fix Summary

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Problem
The Sales Dashboard was returning 500 Internal Server Error due to database schema mismatches between TypeORM entities and the actual PostgreSQL database.

## Errors Identified
1. **`column Lead.lead_score does not exist`**
   - The `Lead` entity had a `leadScore` column defined
   - This column was never added to the database via migration
   - TypeORM was trying to query this non-existent column

2. **`column Booking.agreement_amount does not exist`**
   - The `Booking` entity had an `agreementAmount` column defined
   - This column was never added to the database via migration
   - TypeORM was trying to query this non-existent column

## Solution Applied

### 1. Lead Entity Fix
**File:** `backend/src/modules/leads/entities/lead.entity.ts`
- Commented out the `leadScore` column definition (lines 158-160)
- Added a note explaining the column doesn't exist in the database
- Can be added back later with a proper migration if needed

### 2. Booking Entity Fix
**File:** `backend/src/modules/bookings/entities/booking.entity.ts`
- Commented out the `agreementAmount` column definition (lines 92-94)
- Added a note explaining the column doesn't exist in the database

### 3. Booking DTO Fix
**File:** `backend/src/modules/bookings/dto/booking-response.dto.ts`
- Commented out the `agreementAmount` property in the DTO class (line 13)
- Commented out the assignment of `agreementAmount` in the mapping logic (line 77)

## Steps Taken
1. Identified missing columns by analyzing error logs
2. Verified columns don't exist in any SQL migration files
3. Commented out the problematic entity column definitions
4. Fixed the related DTO files that referenced these columns
5. Rebuilt the TypeScript backend (`npm run build`)
6. Restarted the development server
7. Verified no more errors related to these columns

## Result
✅ Backend successfully compiled and started
✅ No more database schema errors
✅ Sales Dashboard should now load without 500 errors

## Testing
The Sales Dashboard should now be accessible at: `http://localhost:3000/sales`

## Future Considerations
If `leadScore` or `agreementAmount` are needed in the future:
1. Create a proper database migration SQL file
2. Add the columns to the database
3. Uncomment the entity definitions
4. Uncomment the DTO properties
5. Test thoroughly

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/modules/leads/entities/lead.entity.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/bookings/entities/booking.entity.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/bookings/dto/booking-response.dto.ts`
