cd /Users/arnav/Desktop/Train-Rex.nosync/eastern-estate-erp/backend
npm run start:dev
```

**Frontend** (should already be running):  
```bash
cd /Users/arnav/Desktop/Train-Rex.nosync/eastern-estate-erp/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Your Browser and Login

1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/login**

2. Login with these credentials:
   - **Email**: `superadmin@easternestates.com`
   - **Password**: `Password@123`

### Step 3: Access Sales Dashboard

## 🔍 If You Still Can't Access:

1. **Check if you're logged in**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab → Local Storage
   - Check if `accessToken` exists
   - If not, go back to step 2 and log in again

2. **Check console for errors**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any red errors
   - Send me a screenshot if you see errors

3. **Verify servers are running**:
   ```bash
   # Check backend
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1
   
   # Check frontend  
   curl http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 💡 Quick Test:

Run this to test the login API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "superadmin@easternestates.com", "password": "Password@123"}'
```

Expected response (this means login is working!):
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "user": {
    "id": "0e034d20-3aa4-4dff-b90f-126bff07a5c1",
    "email": "superadmin@easternestates.com",
    "firstName": "Super",
    "lastName": "Admin"
  }
}
```
