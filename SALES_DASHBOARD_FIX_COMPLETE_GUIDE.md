# üéØ Sales Dashboard 500 Error - COMPLETE FIX GUIDE

## üìã Problem Summary

The Sales Dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/sales` is showing **500 Internal Server Error** because the NestJS backend entities expect database columns that don't exist in your PostgreSQL database.

### Root Cause
When the Sales CRM module was created, new entity fields were added to the TypeScript code, but the corresponding database columns were never added to PostgreSQL. This causes TypeORM to generate SQL queries that reference non-existent columns, resulting in database errors.

### Missing Columns Identified
- **Leads table**: ~50 missing columns (assigned_at, preferred_location, requirements, etc.)
- **Bookings table**: ~40 missing columns (token_payment_mode, token_receipt_number, etc.)

## üöÄ SOLUTION - Two Options

### Option 1: Automated Script (RECOMMENDED) ‚≠ê

Run the automated migration script:

```bash
cd /Users/arnav/Desktop/Train-Rex.nosync/eastern-estate-erp/backend
./run-migration.sh
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Prompt you to create a database backup (recommended)
2. ‚úÖ Run the migration to add all missing columns
3. ‚úÖ Verify the changes were applied successfully
4. ‚úÖ Show you the next steps

---

### Option 2: Manual Migration

If you prefer to run the migration manually:

```bash
cd /Users/arnav/Desktop/Train-Rex.nosync/eastern-estate-erp/backend

# 1. Create backup (IMPORTANT!)
pg_dump -h localhost -U arnav -d eastern_estate_erp > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# 2. Run migration
psql -h localhost -U arnav -d eastern_estate_erp -f add-missing-sales-crm-columns.sql

# 3. Verify
psql -h localhost -U arnav -d eastern_estate_erp -c "\d leads"
psql -h localhost -U arnav -d eastern_estate_erp -c "\d bookings"
```

---

## üìù After Migration

### Step 1: Restart Backend
```bash
cd /Users/arnav/Desktop/Train-Rex.nosync/eastern-estate-erp/backend

# Kill existing backend
pkill -9 node

# Start fresh
npm run start:dev
```

### Step 2: Test Sales Dashboard
1. Open browser: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Login with:
   - Email: `superadmin@easternestates.com`
   - Password: `Password@123`
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/sales`
4. **The dashboard should now load without 500 errors!** ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Running Migration

1. **BACKUP YOUR DATABASE** - Always create a backup before running migrations
2. **Test Environment** - If possible, test on a non-production database first
3. **Maintenance Window** - Consider running during low-traffic period
4. **Permissions** - Ensure you have ALTER TABLE permissions

### After Running Migration

1. **Restart Backend** - Required for changes to take effect
2. **Clear Cache** - Browser cache may need to be cleared
3. **Test Thoroughly** - Test all Sales Dashboard features
4. **Monitor Logs** - Watch backend logs for any remaining errors

---

## üîÑ Rollback Procedure

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# Restore from backup
psql -h localhost -U arnav -d eastern_estate_erp < backup_YYYYMMDD.sql

# Restart backend
cd /Users/arnav/Desktop/Train-Rex.nosync/eastern-estate-erp/backend
pkill -9 node
npm run start:dev
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

## üìû Troubleshooting

### Error: "relation does not exist"
- **Solution**: Make sure you're connected to the correct database

### Error: "permission denied"
- **Solution**: Ensure user has ALTER TABLE permissions

### Error: "duplicate column name"
- **Solution**: Some columns may already exist, the script handles this with `IF NOT EXISTS`

### Backend still shows errors
- **Solution**: 
  1. Clear dist folder: `rm -rf dist && npm run build`
  2. Restart backend: `pkill -9 node && npm run start:dev`
  3. Clear browser cache and reload
