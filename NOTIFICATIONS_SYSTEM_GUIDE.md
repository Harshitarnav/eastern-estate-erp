  }
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
cd backend
psql -U your_username -d eastern_estate_erp -f create-notifications-table.sql
```

### 2. Verify Backend Module

The NotificationsModule is already configured in the backend. Ensure it's imported in `app.module.ts`:

```typescript
import { NotificationsModule } from './modules/notifications/notifications.module';

@Module({
  imports: [
    // ... other modules
    NotificationsModule,
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### 3. Access Notifications Page

Navigate to `/notifications` in your application to view all notifications.

## Role-Department Mapping

The system uses the following mapping for department-based notifications:

- **SALES**: Sales Manager, Sales Executive, Sales Team Lead
- **MARKETING**: Marketing Manager, Marketing Executive
- **OPERATIONS**: Operations Manager, Operations Executive
- **FINANCE**: Finance Manager, Accountant, Finance Executive
- **HR**: HR Manager, HR Executive
- **IT**: IT Manager, IT Executive, Developer
- **CONSTRUCTION**: Construction Manager, Construction Supervisor, Construction Executive
- **CUSTOMER_SERVICE**: Customer Service Manager, Customer Service Executive
- **MANAGEMENT**: CEO, Director, General Manager

You can customize this mapping in `backend/src/modules/notifications/notifications.service.ts`.

## Email Integration

The email functionality is ready to be integrated. To enable:

1. Configure email settings in your `.env` file:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=Eastern Estate ERP <noreply@easternestae.com>
EMAIL_ADMIN=admin@easternestae.com
EMAIL_SECURE=false
```

2. Set `shouldSendEmail: true` when creating notifications

## UI Features

The notifications page includes:

- **Filter by Status**: View all or only unread notifications
- **Real-time Updates**: Notifications update in real-time
- **Mark as Read**: Click on individual notifications or use bulk action
- **Delete Notifications**: Remove unwanted notifications
- **Clear Read**: Bulk delete all read notifications
- **Action Links**: Click notifications to navigate to related pages
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded by type, icons for categories
- **Timestamp**: Shows how long ago the notification was created

## Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Categories**: Always set the correct category for filtering
2. **Set Priority**: Use priority 1-10 (10 being highest) for important notifications
3. **Include Action Links**: Make notifications actionable when possible
4. **Clear Messages**: Write concise, actionable notification messages
5. **Email Sparingly**: Only send emails for critical notifications
6. **Set Expiry**: Use expiry dates for time-sensitive notifications
7. **Use Metadata**: Store additional context in the metadata field

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:

1. Real-time WebSocket notifications
2. Push notifications for mobile
3. Notification preferences per user
4. Notification templates
5. Scheduled notifications
6. Notification analytics
7. Rich media in notifications (images, videos)
8. Notification groups/threads
9. Snooze functionality
10. Custom notification sounds

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications not appearing
- Check if the user has the correct role/department
- Verify the notification was created successfully in the database
- Check the expiry date (if set)

### Email not sending
- Verify email configuration in `.env`
- Check the email service logs
- Ensure `shouldSendEmail` is set to `true`

### Performance issues
- The system uses database indexes for optimal performance
- Consider implementing pagination for users with many notifications
- Use the cleanup function regularly to remove expired notifications
